    "\n",
    "[Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://enterprise.github.com/downloads/en/markdown-cheatsheet.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Headings\n",
    "To create a heading, add one to six # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the hierarchy level and typeface size of the heading.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Styling text\n",
    "Bold\t** ** or __ __  \n",
    "Italic\t* * or _ _  \n",
    "Strikethrough\t~~~~  \n",
    "Subscript\tsub in <>  \n",
    "Superscript\tsup in <>  \n",
    "Underline\tins in <>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quoting text\n",
    "You can quote text with a >.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quoting code\n",
    "You can call out code or a command within a sentence with single backticks. The text within the backticks will not be formatted. You can also press the Command+E (Mac) or Ctrl+E (Windows/Linux) keyboard shortcut to insert the backticks for a code block within a line of Markdown.\n",
    "To format code or text into its own distinct block, use triple backticks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supported color models\n",
    "In issues, pull requests, and discussions, you can call out colors within a sentence by using backticks. A supported color model within backticks will display a visualization of the color.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the currently supported color models.  \n",
    "HEX\t#RRGGBB  \n",
    "RGB\trgb(R,G,B)  \n",
    "HSL\thsl(H,S,L)  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Links\n",
    "You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ). You can also use the keyboard shortcut Command+K to create a link. When you have text selected, you can paste a URL from your clipboard to automatically create a link from the selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also create a Markdown hyperlink by highlighting the text and using the keyboard shortcut Command+V. If you'd like to replace the text with the link, use the keyboard shortcut Command+Shift+V.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section links\n",
    "You can link directly to any section that has a heading. To view the automatically generated anchor in a rendered file, hover over the section heading to expose the  icon and click the icon to display the anchor in your browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Related links\n",
    "You can define relative links and image paths in your rendered files to help readers navigate to other files in your repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "A relative link is a link that is relative to the current file. For example, if you have a README file in root of your repository, and you have another file in docs/CONTRIBUTING.md, the relative link to CONTRIBUTING.md in your README might look like this: [Contribution guidelines for this project](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub will automatically transform your relative link or image path based on whatever branch you're currently on, so that the link or path always works. The path of the link will be relative to the current file. Links starting with / will be relative to the repository root. You can use all relative link operands, such as ./ and ../.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Custom anchors\n",
    "You can use standard HTML anchor tags (<a name=\"unique-anchor-name\"></a>) to create navigation anchor points for any location in the document. To avoid ambiguous references, use a unique naming scheme for anchor tags, such as adding a prefix to the name attribute value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Line breaks\n",
    "To create a line break in an .md file, you will need to include one of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Include two spaces at the end of the first line.\n",
    "* Include a backslash at the end of the first line.\n",
    "* Include an HTML single line break tag at the end of the first line.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you leave a blank line between two lines, both .md files and Markdown in issues, pull requests, and discussions will render the two lines separated by the blank line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Images\n",
    "You can display an image by adding ! and wrapping the alt text in [ ]. Alt text is a short text equivalent of the information in the image. Then, wrap the link for the image in parentheses ().\n",
    "\n",
    "![Screenshot of a comment on a GitHub issue showing an image, added in the Markdown, of an Octocat smiling and raising a tentacle.](https://myoctocat.com/assets/images/base-octocat.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lists\n",
    "You can make an unordered list by preceding one or more lines of text with -, *, or +.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nested lists\n",
    "You can create a nested list by indenting one or more list items below another item.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a nested list using the web editor on GitHub or a text editor that uses a monospaced font, like Visual Studio Code, you can align your list visually. Type space characters in front of your nested list item until the list marker character (- or *) lies directly below the first character of the text in the item above it.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a nested list in the comment editor on GitHub, which doesn't use a monospaced font, you can look at the list item immediately above the nested list and count the number of characters that appear before the content of the item. Then type that number of space characters in front of the nested list item.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create multiple levels of nested lists using the same method. For example, because the first nested list item has seven characters (␣␣␣␣␣-␣) before the nested list content First nested list item, you would need to indent the second nested list item by at least two more characters (nine spaces minimum).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task lists\n",
    "To create a task list, preface list items with a hyphen and space followed by [ ]. To mark a task as complete, use [x].\n",
    "\n",
    "If a task list item description begins with a parenthesis, you'll need to escape it with \\:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Uploading assets\n",
    "You can upload assets like images by dragging and dropping, selecting from a file browser, or pasting. You can upload assets to issues, pull requests, comments, and .md files in your repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using emojis\n",
    "You can add emoji to your writing by typing :EMOJICODE:, a colon followed by the name of the emoji.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typing : will bring up a list of suggested emoji. The list will filter as you type, so once you find the emoji you're looking for, press Tab or Enter to complete the highlighted result.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a full list of available emoji and codes, see the [Emoji-Cheat-Sheet](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Paragraphs\n",
    "You can create a new paragraph by leaving a blank line between lines of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hiding content with comments\n",
    "You can tell GitHub to hide content from the rendered Markdown by placing the content in an HTML comment."
